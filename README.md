# **Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analyzer**

This project is a **web-based application** that scrapes Amazon product reviews and performs **sentiment analysis** using a pre-trained `roBERTa` model. The app analyzes customer reviews to determine the overall sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) and provides the results through a simple web interface built with **Flask**.

   cd amazon-review-sentiment-analyzer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Chrome WebDriver**:  
   - Make sure **Google Chrome** is installed on your machine.
   - Download the appropriate version of **Chromedriver** from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and place it in your project directory or add it to your PATH.

## **Usage**

1. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to:

## **How it Works**

1. **User Input**: The user provides an **Amazon product URL**.  
2. **Web Scraping**: The **Selenium-based scraper** navigates through the reviews page and collects customer reviews across all pages.  
3. **Preprocessing**: The text reviews are cleaned (removing usernames and URLs).  
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The **roBERTa model** analyzes the sentiment of each review.
5. **Result Calculation**: Average scores are computed for each sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
6. **Output**: The results are displayed on the web page.

---

## **Demo**

Below is an example of how the results are displayed:

- **Sentiment Analysis for Product X:**
  - **Positive**: 0.85  
  - **Neutral**: 0.10  
  - **Negative**: 0.05
